# Joint-Bayesian.
>According to the paper *"Bayesian Face Revisited: A Joint Formulation"*, the repository realizes the algorithm of Joint Beyesian with **Python** and achieve almost the same result as the paper.

# Prepare for Using.
 >1. Get the database (lbp_WDRef,id_WDRef,lbp_lfw,pairlist_lfw)
 Download from the Websit: http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~chendong/JointBayesian/
 >2. Install the numpy & scipy
 >3. Install the sklearn
 

# Usage
>cd src

>python test_lfw.py

# Performance
